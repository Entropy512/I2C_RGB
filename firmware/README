I2C RGB LED driver in an ATTiny25

Requires avr-gcc and avr-libc

Control the LED's color by sending three bytes to the driver's I2C address, one each of
Red, Green, Blue color.

This code is currently configured to drive a common anode LED.  It can be recompiled to support common cathode LEDs by changing a #define

The I2C address defaults to 0x32 unless the first entry in the EEPROM is a valid I2C address, in which case that address is used for the EEPROM.
